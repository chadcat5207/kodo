  Startuptime: 17.58ms <br>
  List of plugins can be found in a readme in <a href="https://github.com/chadcat7/kodo/tree/main/lua/plugs">lua/plugs</a> folder. <br> <br>

  Based on the actual CPU time of the Neovim process till UIEnter. <br>
  This is more accurate than `nvim --startuptime`. <br>
    LazyStart 7.11ms <br>
    LazyDone  12.27ms (+5.16ms) <br>
    UIEnter   17.58ms (+5.31ms) <br>

Special Thanks  <br>
This config wouldn't have been possible without these chads!
